# Garage
Android Application to register activities for a garage 

The application allow a user to make a booking and display all the bookings. This program allow an administrator to display all the bookings, 
allocate mechanics, change status of the bookings and print a schedule (Pdf document)

I used Android Studio IDE, Java Programming Language and Firebase (Firestore and Authentication Service)
